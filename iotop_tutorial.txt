iotop is an open source and free utility similar to top command, that provides an easy way to monitor Linux Disk I/O usage 
details and prints a table of existing I/O utilization by process or threads on the systems.

iotop displays columns for:

Thread ID (TID)
I/O Priority class/level (PRIO)
the owner of the thread with TID (USER)
the disk read per second (DISK READ)
the disk write per second (DISK WRITE)
the percentage of time the thread spent while swapping in (SWAPIN)
the percentage of time the thread spent waiting on I/O (IO>)
the command the thread is running (COMMAND)

as root user:
1.) yum install iotop -y 

2.) setup cron to run iotop
crontab -e

#Splunk IOTOP
* * * * *  /usr/sbin/iotop -botqqq --iter=60 | grep -P "\d\d\.\d\d K/s" >> /var/log/iotop.log

3.) setup log rotate for iotop.log

vi /etc/logrotate.d/iotop
# add the following
/var/log/iotop.log {
  rotate 3
  size 50M
  daily
  maxage 15
  compress
  notifempty
  missingok
}


4.) setup splunk input monitor to read the iotop.log: 
note: adjust index as needed

[monitor:///var/log/iotop.log]
disabled = false
sourcetype = iotop
index = main
blacklist = \*.gz


5.) setup props.conf for this sourcetype : 

[iotop]
TIME_FORMAT = %H:%M:%S
MAX_TIMESTAMP_LOOKAHEAD = 10
LINE_BREAKER=([\r\n]+)\d{2}\:\d{2}\:\d{2}
SHOULD_LINEMERGE=false
NO_BINARY_CHECK=true
DATETIME_CONFIG=CURRENT
TZ=UTC


restart splunk
./splunk restart


6.) run a search to find the data in splunk and identify which TID/COMMAND is putting heavy IO usage  READ/WRITEs

index=main sourcetype=iotop source=*/var/log/iotop.log*
|rex "\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\s+(?<TID>\d+)\s+(?<PRIO>\S+)\s+(?<USER>\S+)\s+(?<DISK_READ>\S+)\s+(?<runit>\S+)\s+(?<DISK_WRITE>\S+)\s+(?<wunit>\S+)\s+(?<SWAPIN>\S+)\s+\%\s+(?<IO>\S+)\s+\%\s+(?<COMMAND>.+)"
